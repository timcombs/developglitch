# Philosophy of Project
- I think much about how I learned to see the world at an early age
- I also asked questions about how the world worked
- As I matured, I decided I wanted to change the world
- Eventually, I learned to communicate what I saw about the world
- Through this process I learned to be critical about what others told me about the world, I learned to challenge their assumptions.
- As I grew more, I used my ability to communicate a personal vision to inspire people
- I used my vision to collaborate with others so they could change the world of their communities

- I find that Fowler's theory of moral development helps to describe my development
- As does my limited understanding of the Tao.
